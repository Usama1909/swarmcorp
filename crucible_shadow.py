"""
Crucible Shadow Service — observes ARIA, judges strategy cells.
Now SELF-CALIBRATING: each cycle it measures per-regime noise from ARIA's
outcome history, derives gate strictness (bounded + smoothed), feeds it into
the decision layer, and logs the calibration so you can watch it adapt.

Writes:
  crucible_verdicts     original DSR honesty-gate verdict
  crucible_decisions    graded action (regime-aware, self-calibrated)
  crucible_calibration  the strictness chosen per regime, per cycle (audit log)
